## Iris Species Prediction with CircleCI
Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end MLOps workflow using the popular Iris dataset to build a machine learning model that predicts the species of Iris flowers. 
The model is trained using Pythonâ€™s scikit-learn library, and the entire pipeline is integrated with CircleCI for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD).
